# `.PKG` -> `.DMG` Convertor
### A tool to create `.dmg` from Apple's `.pkg` ðŸŽŠ
### NOTE: Runs on Linux only. Use VM for Windows.
- The script will automatically create `.dmg` & save it to desired location.
- it will be bootable hence can be used for Hackintosh or MacOS
- also works with my another script [Automated-macOS-Installer](https://www.github.com/cdude1909/Automated-macOS-Installer)

## Requirements

Make sure you have this dependencies pre-installed,
- 16 GB `.dmg` will be created hence make sure you have enough space
- python3.3+ (it will cover all the required pip dependencies ;) ) 
- `InstallAssistant.pkg` (Can be downloaded externally from [Mr.macintosh](https://mrmacintosh.com/how-to-download-macos-catalina-mojave-or-high-sierra-full-installers/))

## Run
Simply,
```
git clone https://www.github.com/Cdude1909/PKG2DMG/
sudo ./pkg2dmg.sh
```
